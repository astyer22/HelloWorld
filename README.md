# Overview
This program is a simple "Hello World" application. It displays my name and the current date when the program is run.

As a software engineer, I am always eager to explore and master new coding languages. Recently, I delved into C# and learned how to use classes and specific constructs within the language.
To practice my newfound skills, I wrote this "Hello World" program.

# Development Environment

after writing the code I was sure how to get it running, I consulted ChatGPT for guidance. ChatGPT helped me set up the project and the instruction on how to use the "dotnet" in the terminal" 

I wrote the program in C#, a language known for its simplicity and structure. The use of classes in C# helps keep the code organized and efficient.
